# WPCS Core Extra Sniffs

Repository with various extra [PHPCodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) sniffs for WordPress to extend what is linted by the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) package.

These extra sniffs are based on less explicitly enforced, but still clearly outlined coding standard rules. Some examples:

* there should be a `@since` tag in every doc block
* correct order of tags in every doc block
* correct usage of blank lines between tags in every doc block
* proper indentation and alignment for different segments of a tag in the same group
* ending every doc block description in a full stop
* documenting functions and methods using a third-person verb
